    Added possibility of checking a range of radii

GERT_DrawElement_Image
    Fixed cropping outside image range

GERT_GenerateContour_FileSVG
    Fixed bug when the last coordinate is a whole number

GERT_PlaceElements_Contour
    Fixed some potential crashes

Version 1.20 31/05/2013
-----------------------

Several files
    Adapted code to the changes made to set functions in R2013a

@GElements
    Added the rmid() function here as well

@GLog
    Added extra system information for Linux and Octave users
    Does not require the fenv package anymore for Octave users

GERT_CheckCue_LocalDensity
    Changed outputted p-value for RadCount so '1' means 'idx1 less dense'
    Added check that border_dist may not be smaller than rad

GERT_Demo
    Fixed IMAGE_PATH separator for Octave users under Linux

GERT_DrawElement_Ellipse
    Improved compatibility with older Matlab versions

GERT_DrawElement_Image
    Fixed IMAGE_PATH separator for Octave users under Linux

GERT_DrawElement_Polygon
    Fixed bug with colored elements, in case of a white FG or a black BG color
    Improved compatibility with older Matlab versions

GERT_GenerateContour_SVG
    Fixed bug with smooth Bezier curves
    Improved compatibility with older Matlab versions
    Added a check so Octave users cannot read in discontinuous paths
    Corrected the help: 1xN GContour array is returned when the SVG is discontinuous

GERT_GenerateContour_TXT
    There is now a strict requirement of two columns for Octave users

GERT_PlaceElements_Contour
    Drastically changed the equidistant methods:
        - el_n can also be provided, instead of cont_avgdist
        - Position jitter values are now a proportion of cont_avgdist
          Check the help to understand what they do
    Fixed a bug where open, equidistant contours would contain the first element twice  

GERT_RenderDisplay
    Fixed bug when n=1  

GERT_Version
    Version information is now read from version.txt


Version 1.11 02/03/2012
-----------------------

GERT_CheckCue_LocalDensity
    Fixed a bug where border_dist was required to be an integer number

GERT_PlaceElements_Background 
    Elements are now placed correctly in a rectangular display
    
GERT_RenderDisplay
    Global rendering no longer produces identical elements when no scalar constants have been defined in the element parameter structure


Version 1.10 13/12/2011
----------------------

GERT_CheckCue_LocalDensity
    Now involves all GElements points in computations, when only a subset is provided for the density comparison

GERT_DrawElement_GContour
    Elements are no longer flipped along the y-axis in this function (see GERT_GenerateContour_FileSVG)

GERT_DrawElement_RadialGabor 
    Added as a new drawing function

GERT_GenerateContour_Ellipse.m
    Fixed bug where rotated open contours would become closed

GERT_GenerateContour_FileSVG
    SVG contours are now automatically flipped along the y-axis

GERT_GenerateContour_RFP
    Fixed bug where rotated open contours would become closed

GERT_PlaceElements_Background 
    Default value for 'resolution' is now constant at 500
    Background points are now shuffled afterwards to avoid serial effects in their positioning
    Fixed a rounding error that could yield invalid converted coordinates in some situations

GERT_PlaceElements_Contour
    When using 'Random' placement, default value for 'resolution' is now constant at 500
    When using 'Random' placement, fixed two rounding errors that could yield invalid converted coordinates in some situations
    When using 'Random' placement, fixed a bug where vertical coordinates would be converted by the same ratio as horizontal coordinates

GERT_RenderDisplay
    Global rendering now also works properly with an empty element parameter struct

GERT_Transform_Rotate 
    Fixed so that the local tangents of GContour objects are now rotated as well


Version 1.0 16/08/2011
